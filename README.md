Data gotten by the wiki (https://txchainsawgame.wiki.spellsandguns.com/The_Texas_Chain_Saw_Massacre_Wiki) testing thanks to 
communities at @ScubanautSteve and @StarlitFox on twitch

Started development 9/12/2023

The plan for this program (so far) is to simply show, given what family member is being played, what the most effective savagery is
in terms of the most commonly run toughness (gauged simply by the even numbers of toughness, so maybe not as accurate as something
with better data of who runs numbers of toughness)

Use: Input family member being played (SPELLED THE EXACT WAY AS SPELLED IN GAME), input stat numbers, returns how much your savagery
does for your character based on toughness (in increments of 5), returns how much blood gain you get per hit, execution, or blood
bucket, and will return cost of actions
